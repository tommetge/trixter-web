# Trixter Web

Trixter Web is a (very simple) web frontend for the Trixter Dream Bike.
Currently, the interface shows the difficulty (level of resistance) and
the rotations per minute of the pedals.

More will come soon.

## Installation

Follow the instructions for installing the trixter gem
(https://github.com/tommetge/trixter). Once you've installed this
dependency, then clone this repo and:

```
bundle install
ruby init.rb
```

Note: You need to plug in your XDream before starting the UI.

## Screenshot

Yeah, it's pretty much obligatory. Theme credits go to Alex Vanderzon
